        *   you will learn something, but does it worth the time? Specially when you may forget about it 
        *   till the next time you actually need to know about it. 
        * 2. Just use it to solve your problem, maybe a small test to understand its potentiallity. So

        * Of course, each option has its advantages and disadvatanges.
